# nmm-week4

Welcome to Classical hell! From this week we forget about electrons and embrace the simpler times when particles were particles and waves were waves. In other words, Molecular Dynamics based on classical equations of motion. This allows our models to reach larger scales of atomistic processes. Week 4 in particular is dedicated to all-atom simulations, the critical importance of MD force fields, and atomistic processes of relevance for nanomaterials.

## Assignment 1

Let's use your first MD assignment to break the ice. Literally! In this assignment you will play with phase changes of water and how they depend on the chosen water model.

### Instructions

1a Setup and run the simulation in.tip3p_Water (TAKE AND TEST FROM HERE https://docs.lammps.org/Howto_tip3p.html). Varying temperature, determine 
the crystallization and boiling temperature of the model. Structurally characterize the solid, liquid, and gas phases with snapshots and standard metrics such as density, degree of crystallinity, or radial distribution functions.

1b Switch to the more complex tip4p model (IN PRINCIPLE HERE https://docs.lammps.org/Howto_tip4p.html, TO TEST. DECIDE HOW MUCH TO GIVE AND HOW MUCH ASK THEM TO FIND). of water and repeat the assignment described in 1a.
