## Assignment 1

Before running new simulations, familiarize yourself with the visualization software [Ovito](https://www.ovito.org/)! You will use it for the entire course. 
With Ovito you can visualize and render the trajectories of your simulations (both images and videos) and perform some rudimentary data analysis on the fly.

### Instructions

1a. visualize Quantum Espresso simulations

Load the Quantum Espresso file, perform some analyses.

1b. visualize Lammps simulations
